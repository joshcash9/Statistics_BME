# Statistics_BME
Graduate Level Statistics Course with Biomedical Engineering Examples
Understanding statistical analyses is an essential skill for scientists in academia and industry. Here we will discuss the philosophy of hypothesis testing, simulate datasets via random sampling, and perform parametric and nonparametric tests. In additional to traditional tests (mean comparison, regression, ANOVA) we will also introduce some advanced techniques (maximum likelihood, Bayes, bootstrapping, and MCMC).
